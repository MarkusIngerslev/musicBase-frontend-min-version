# MusicBase Frontend By Markus Ingerslev

This is my own attempt at a frontend site to `read, show & handle` a `MySQL` database in a fanzy and beautiful way. The project is inspiret by an already completet project that I and a group of my fellow students made for our degree.

This reason for me to make one more frontend page for the database, is only so that I can get a better udnerstanding about `classes, constructor's, methods & reading from MySQL`.

The original project which this is inspired of can be found [here](https://github.com/JonLundby/music-base-frontend-jmmp.git)!
